# :musical_keyboard: HacknRoll 2019 - SynARThesia :musical_keyboard:

Synesthesia is the perceptual phenomenon of interconnected sensory simulation. People with synesthesia can smell numbers or hear colours. This projects wants to give regular people the synesthetic experience in art, linking auditory action to visual sensation condition. The idea is simple - use the keyboard to play a song, and the engine will generate an artwork based on your song.

### SynArt

Ever worked on a feature that you needed a break from? SynarThesia offers people a space to be comfortably creative. Using familiar tunes, you can create explosive artworks that are unique.

SynArts are created using a keyboard piano. Each row on the keyboard represents an octave, and you can play a variety of melodies. The sequences of notes played create a myriad of paint splatters on the canvas. We want to showcase the creativity in synesthetics. Colourful. Melodic. SynarThesia stands at the crossroads of art and technology.

SynArts can be imported and exported. What is art without its shared understanding?

Yes, we also know that art is "useless" hence SynarThesia is awesomely useless.
Synthesising SynarThesia

We built the webpage by tapping into a wealth of existing frameworks, namely jQuery and Bootstrap. Our images were designed in GIMP.

SynarThesia is about putting everything together to give you The Synesthetic Experience.

### Learning from our Challenges

There are a multitude of solutions for the same problem. In the same way, SynarThesia hopes to convey this way of thought. There are multiple ways to represent art and music, each uniquely creative.

There were a lot of features we wished we had more time to work on:

- Drag-and-drop re-import of our recording files
- Audio export
- Programmatically generated paint splatters, instead of drawing them on GIMP

### What's next for SynarThesia

We hope to record the playing process and export the video. Art is afterall, a process to be listened to.

Try out the [demo](https://synarthesia.herokuapp.com/synarthesia.html). Unfortunately, this demo takes a really long time to load. At the time of the hackathon, we had no idea that HTML5 Canvases were just so slow on Heroku.
